Overview:
The EdTech Waste Management Research website showcases a collection of innovative sustainability education projects developed at Santa Clara University. The research highlights the use of emerging technologies—such as AI-powered waste detectors, augmented reality feedback systems, gamified web applications, and LLMs - to improve environmental literacy and promote sustainable behavior.
Some of the key initiatives include the Waste Genie platform, the MyEcoPal behavioral toolkit, and various AI-integrated tools designed to bridge the gap between environmental awareness and real-world action. Users can explore interactive tools, visual content, academic publications, and insights from years of research in educational technology and sustainability.

My Role and Process:
To bring this content to life, I reimagined an outdated version of the site through a user-centered design lens. Using Claude, I guided content rewriting and section restructuring with prompts grounded in UX and web usability principles such as:
- Visual hierarchy
- Information architecture
- Grouping and alignment
- White space optimization
- Readability and scannability
- Content chunking

The site includes built-in light/dark mode toggling for accessibility and visual comfort, along with a top navigation bar that allows users to jump directly to key sections without endless scrolling. These design choices, paired with clean layout structure and clear visual hierarchy, make the site both easy on the eyes and highly efficient to navigate.

Claude served as a collaborative writing partner, helping me transform technical content into clearer, more engaging language tailored for a wider audience interacting with the website. Once the content structure aligned with my design vision, I used Replit as a streamlined web-based IDE to implement, preview, and refine the layout. My focus throughout was on improving usability, enhancing user flow, and modernizing the overall experience for those engaging with the site’s research.
